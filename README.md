# GilmoreTrade
This will be partly notes and a hodgpodge of indicators from my understanding of Bryce Gilmore's many books.
Suggestions are:

1. I have a working elliot wave script - see pics. He suggests not using it to trade, but to understand the direction of the market with wave 5. He reviews these on daily and weekly charts during the week.

2. look for mid day volume spikes as it may continue the trend into close.
3. need hammer or V day from prior SPX
4. need market rotation for /ES, MIN, and OEX. see picture to create label code
